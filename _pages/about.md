# About Me

I am **Jieming Bian**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Engineering at the **University of Florida**, advised by Prof. [Jie Xu](https://jiexu.ece.ufl.edu/). Before joining UF, I was a master student at Columbia University, major in Operations Research. My research focuses on **Federated Learning**, **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**, and **Large Foundation Models**.
